          Investopedia article discussing the fundamentals of financial literacy and the significance of being knowledgeable about your finances. Touches on subjects such as why financial literacy matters, benefits of financial literacy, and strategies to improve financial literacy skills. The article covers specific statistics that concern upcoming generations and their declining rate of comfortable living due to the frequency of financial illiteracy. “Financial literacy gives an individual the tools and resources they need to be financially secure throughout their life. The lack of financial literacy can lead to many pitfalls, such as overspending and accumulating unsustainable debt burdens. This, in turn, can lead to poor credit, bankruptcy, housing foreclosure, or other negative consequences.”

          Research done at a public university in Massachusetts to determine the rate of financial literacy in students and connections between those rates and the increasing rates of student debt. The researchers discuss how minorities have statistically acquired more student debt due to higher rates of financial illiteracy. “our findings suggest that financial literacy can have an important role in explaining the increasing rate of student loan defaults. Looney and Yannelis (2015) show that the rise of student loan default rates, in recent years, is mainly associated with the increase of non-traditional borrowers, students that come from disadvantaged backgrounds and attend non-selective institutions.”
